• The client, The Gaming Room, wanted a web-based game called Draw it or Lose it, inspired by Win, Lose or Draw, where teams guess images revealed over time; the software needed to support unique naming, multiple teams, single-instance enforcement, and smooth cross-device play.
• I made the details clear and well-organized, so both technical and non-technical people can easily understand what’s needed to build, run, and manage the game successfully.
• Working through the domain document was helpful because it simplified how the main parts of the game (like Game, Team, and Player) relate to each other, which made it much easier to structure the code, plan classes, and keep everything organized and consistent.
• If I could revise one part, I’d focus on making the requirements and design constraints clearer and more detailed. Adding examples or scenarios would help ensure everyone fully understands what’s needed and how the game should function.
• I used the design template to turn the client’s needs like unique names, one game at a time, and team support into a clear plan. Thinking about users helped make sure the software is easy to use, reliable, and does what it’s supposed to.
• I started by understanding the client’s goals and breaking down the game into key parts like players, teams, and rounds. I used clear organization and mapping of requirements to the system design. In the future, I’d add more user feedback early on and use diagrams to visualize the structure better before coding.
